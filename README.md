# best banner script for terminal 2020
always better and different

better than the standard toilet,figlet or cowsay banner softwares
 fully customizable since it's written in bash script
 you can add you name or your sentence to expressions= variable to see it in the banner
 it's fully dynamic with an infinite number of themes since it chooses COLORS AND TEXT TO SHOW randomly
 i started this project four hours ago , i didn't intend to but i was looking for a way to add a banner to my terminal i didn't find any good stuuff so i decided to write this script rapidely
 i will update it as soon as possible to make it more beautiful 
very easy to install 

open /root/.bashrc with any text file viewer , i prefer nano
add this line to the end of the .bashrc file
