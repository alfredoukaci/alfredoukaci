# best banner script for terminal 2020
# always better and different

better than the standard toilet,figlet or cowsay banner softwares
fully customizable since it's written in bash script
you can add you name or your sentence to expressions= variable to see it in the banner
it's fully dynamic with an infinite number of themes since it chooses COLORS AND TEXT TO SHOW randomly .

open /root/.bashrc with any text file viewer , i prefer nano
add this line to the end of the .bashrc file
![bashrc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29919378/70843873-376bc400-1e39-11ea-9d37-36dc9670c5b7.png)
